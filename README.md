# Get-MailboxMRMInfo
- Display mailbox info regarding messaging records management (MRM), which used to be known as email life cycle (ELC). (This has to do with archive, retention, and deletion policies.)
- View info about things such as storage limits, archive mailbox, last ELC run, folder sizes, retention tags applied to folders, and MRM error logs.
- Most of this script is leveraging knowledge and cmdlets given in this Microsoft article:  [Troubleshooting email archive, deletion, and retention policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/retention/troubleshoot-mrm-email-archive-deletion)
- This blog post can also help to understand the info obtained by this script: [Behind the scenes with the managed folder assistant](https://www.itprotoday.com/email-and-calendaring/behind-scenes-managed-folder-assistant)
